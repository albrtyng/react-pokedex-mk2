# react-pokedex-mk2
A challenge to myself to build out a pokedex in less than 24 hours
Now has been converted to project where I can continuously mess with new web technologies

## Features include:
search, stat viewing, pokemon cries, etc

## Tech used:
react, typescript, hooks, axios, bootstrap, scss

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production using webpack to the `public` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `yarn serve`

Runs the app via the webpack dev server.<br />
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
